problems&actions (separate?)
- how to change the contract between Presenter and collaborators
-- unit test the collaborators to find out if it is good
-- unit test them early!
--- trade-off between
---- knowing more about the problem before extraction
---- having the feedback of unit tests earlier to decompose the problem
- concentrate on names earlier
- your estimates suck, am I wrong? probably need to timebox or add several Pomodoros.
- produce more design choices before going down into one (e.g. rules for additional/subtractive. Why not other choices?)
- produce more acceptance test cases that force internal refactoring. Otherwise you can get lost extracting and extracting without a direction. The additive-only acceptance tests worked well.
- timebox design improvements and really throw away if they're not improving the situation
